    "  - To show just the most basic of things, experiment with different ways\n",
    "    in which you could define the kernel function. The example uses a lambda\n",
    "    for the kernel. But basically any type of \"executable\" can be used there.\n",
    "    Including simple standalone functions, functors, etc.\n",
    "  - The example uses the simplest form of executing a parallel-for with SYCL.\n",
    "    But in most cases we rather want to control the execution on a GPU in the\n",
    "    same way that you learned from CUDA. Specifying the size of the thread\n",
    "    groups, and the number of thread groups to start.\n",
    "    * This is achieved by using\n",
    "      [sycl::nd_range](https://github.khronos.org/SYCL_Reference/iface/nd_range.html)\n",
    "      instead of\n",
    "      [sycl::range](https://github.khronos.org/SYCL_Reference/iface/range.html)\n",
    "      that the example uses currently.\n",
    "    * Update the code to:\n",
    "      - Provide an appropriate `sycl::nd_range` object to the `parallel_for`\n",
    "        call;\n",
    "      - Update the kernel lambda to take a\n",
    "        [sycl::nd_item](https://github.khronos.org/SYCL_Reference/iface/nd_item.html)\n",
